# Getting Started with Georgia-Frontend App
 This projects give you ability to add a new country, add a new tour for that country. You can edit tour descriptions, or even delete a tour. 
 
This project was done in React for the frontend, and Ruby/Sinatra for the backend. 

Fork and clone Github Front-End Repo and Github Back-End Repo both to a separate folder.

For Front End Directory Run 'npm start' to open the App in your browser

For Back End Directory

Run 'bundle install' to download the Gems 
Run the seeds file to access faker data "bundle exec rake db:seed"
Run the Ruby server "bundle exec rake server"
This will run your server on port [http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292). 


Here is a github for the backend: [https://github.com/ilonagog/phase-3-sinatra-react-project](https://github.com/ilonagog/phase-3-sinatra-react-project).
